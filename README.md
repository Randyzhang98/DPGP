# DPGP
The python version code is implemented by Mengdi Xu, mengdixu@andrew.cmu.edu @SafeAI lab in CMU.
Initial MATLAB code by Yaohui Guo and Vinay Varma Kalidindi
Paper Reference:
Modeling Multi-Vehicle Interaction Scenarios Using Gaussian Random Field
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10307.pdf

Improvement:
The python version code fixed several bugs in the MATLAB version of code.
The code structure is more clear and can easily be implemented for various applications.

Thanks members of SafeAI lab for discussion.
